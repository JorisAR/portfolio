      <description>Rendering large terrains is no easy task. In real time computer graphics, terrains are often large subdivided planes with vertices translated vertically based on a heightmap, but this means that overhangs or caves are impossible without extra work or additional meshes. Instead, we can use a three dimensional volume to represent the terrain. However, if we want a 4 by 4 by 4 kilometer 3D terrain at a 1 cubic meter resolution with just a floating point number at every position, we would need about a quarter terabyte of memory.</description>

      <description>I started studying at TU Delft in september 2020, and I have worked on many projects for courses since then. This is a collection of my proudest work related to computer graphics from my time at university. All other projects listed on my portfolio were made in my free time.&#xA;Pizzicato A serious game developed in 10 weeks with 4 other peers in collaboration with Psychology researchers, during which I was Game Designer and Programmer.</description>
