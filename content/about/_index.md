Hi, I'm Joris, a Computer Scientist from the Netherlands.

I've completed my BSC Computer Science and Engineering at TU Delft in 2023, with a 9.5 for my final thesis.
That same year I started my Masters Computer Science at TU Delft, with a focus on Computer Graphics.
In 2024, I have co-authored two peer reviewed papers. Links TBA.

I plan to graduate in 2025.

## Professional Experience
Between 2020 and 2023, I was active at two different schools as a tutor and homework assistant in Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics for HAVO 5 and VWO 5 & 6. In 2023 I started as a Student Assistant (SA), where I would aid a Professor at TU Delft with Research, specifically by continuing to develop the VR-Environment Holonomy. In 2024 I additionally started as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for Computer Graphics Related Masters courses.

## Hobbies
Other than programming, I love to spend my time playing the piano and guitar, or producing and mixing music using a DAW. I also enjoy playing video games from time to time.
