Hello everyone, My name is **Joris Rijsdijk**, a Dutch Computer Science graduate from TU Delft specializing in Computer Graphics.



## Qualification

In 2020 I graduated highschool Cum Laude, finishing with four 9/10s for Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry.

I've completed my BSc Computer Science and Engineering at TU Delft in 2023, with a 9.5/10 for my final thesis.
That same year I started my Masters Computer Science at TU Delft, with a focus on Computer Graphics.
In 2024, I co-authored two peer-reviewed papers.

In 2025, I completed my MSc Computer Science with a focus on Computer Graphics, Cum Laude. My thesis titled "Stochastic Gaussian Splatting" was awarded with a 9.0/10.


## Professional Experience

Between 2020 and 2023, I was active at two different high schools as a tutor and homework assistant in Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics for HAVO 5 and VWO 5 & 6. 
In 2023, I began working as a Student Assistant (SA) at TU Delft, continuing development of the VR environment "Holonomy", the project I worked on during my bachelor thesis.
In 2024 I additionally was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for a graduate level computer graphics course about 3D rendering and animation.
