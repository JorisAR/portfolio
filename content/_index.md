Hi, my name is Joris Rijsdijk. I am a Dutch Computer Science graduate with a passion for Computer Graphics.

I earned my Master's degree from TU Delft, graduating *Cum Laude* after five years of study. Over that time, I've explored topics ranging from real-time rendering to ray tracing.

This site showcases some of the most exciting projects I've worked on. I hope you enjoy exploring them as much as I enjoyed making them!
